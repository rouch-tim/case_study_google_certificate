#Preparation

Data is located on the cloud, hosted by AWS. There are csv files containing information about:

- Trips per Month for Q2 2020 to 2024 named ‘yyyymm-drivvy-tripdata.csv’
- Information about stations in files named ‘Drivvy_Station_trips_yyyy’

Early remarks: 

- **Data about Stations is outdated**, as our latest version dates from Q4 2017.
- **tripdata files are missing start_station_id, start_station_name, end_station_id, end_station_name data
- **station_id and station_name** data needs to be cleaned from duplicates, unconsistent matches

We will focus on data from '202409-divvy-tripdata.csv'.
